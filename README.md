## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out an advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com)
and get it looking as close to the design provided as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
